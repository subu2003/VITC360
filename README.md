# VITC 360

VIT University's campus is vast and consists of numerous buildings and landmarks, making it challenging for new visitors to navigate. The project aims to address this problem by providing a comprehensive navigation solution. The project includes capturing high-quality 360-degree photographs of various buildings, including both the exterior and interior views. The buildings covered include Aavin Milk Parlour, Health Centre, ATM, Delta Block, AB2, B-Block, C-Block, Gazebo, Lassi House, MGR Statue, Clock Court, Admin block, Central Library, VOC Auditorium, MG Auditorium, AB1, Nethaji Auditorium, A-Block, Gym, GymKhanna, Dominos, and V-Mart. The 360-degree photographs are integrated into an interactive navigation interface, allowing users to select a building or landmark from a list and view the corresponding photograph and audio description. The navigation interface is hosted on a reliable and scalable platform, making it easily accessible to all members of the campus community.The project provides a valuable resource for students, staff, and visitors to navigate the campus effectively. The project components were carefully designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the 360-degree photographs and to ensure the usability, functionality, and performance of the navigation interface. This project serves as a convenient and accessible solution for navigating VIT University's campus, saving time and reducing confusion for visitors.
